# Landing Page Skeleton - React

## About the project:
The aim of this project was to learn build website using React. Using small and big component (which are reusable) to build landing page skeleton. 

This landing page contains:
- header
    - logo
    - menu
- column left (main content):
    - title
    - article
- column rigth (sidebar):
    - category list
    - gallery list
- footer
    - copyright information
    - menu

Each element is represented by separate component.
There are three big components:
* ``` <Header/> ```
* ``` <Content> ```
* ``` <Footer/> ```

which contain smaller components like: ```<Nav/>``` or ```<ContentTitle/>```

```<Nav/>``` component is using twice in header and footer section

I wanted understand how React works and how to use it in a correct way, so I did not focus on appearance part.
