## About the project
The aim of this project was to learn to build website by using React library. I have practiced to build landing page skeleton by using small and big component (which are reusable).

This landing page contains:
- header
    - logo
    - menu
- column left (main content):
    - title
    - article
- column rigth (sidebar):
    - category list
    - gallery list
- footer
    - copyright information
    - menu

Each element is represented by separate component.
There are three large components:
* ``` <Header/> ```
* ``` <Content> ```
* ``` <Footer/> ```

The large components contain smaller components such as: ```<ContentTitle/>```or ```<Nav/>``` which is used twice in header and footer section.

During that practice I focused on to understand how React works and how to use it in a correct way, so I did not pay too much attention to the appearance part. Right now, I can provide my other projects where I focused more on design
and practiced CSS3.
